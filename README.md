# OpenSMTPdAdmin

This is a administration interface for OpenSMTPd based mailing systems. You can edit your domains, your virtual users, their passwords and basic attributes.

Fork of OpenSMTPdAdmin of high5.nl (and PostfixAdmin of course)

## Features

 - 2FA could be easily enabled. You can enable 2FA authentication based on TOTP. Any authenticator application could be used, the QR code is generated by a javascript (client side).

 - Based on SQLite (no need for DB server around). SQLite is absolutely useable for such small scale applications, there is no need to operate (and manage) a database server for this. OpenSMTPd on the other hand comes without MariaDB support (you can recompile, though), thus SQLite is more convenient from the mailer daemon point of view. 

 - Extended logging: all security related operations, like login, logoff, password change, etc., plus all activities (all changes) are logged into the database.
