# OpenSMTPdAdmin

This is a administration interface for OpenSMTPd based mailing systems and the corresponding applications (e.g. IMAP server, like Dovecot). You can edit your domains, your virtual users, their passwords and basic attributes. You can manage aliases pointing into your domain users, or outside. You can also send emails, however it is not thoroughly tested (and probably not the most wanted feature).

## Features

Compared to high5.nl's OpenSTMPdAdmin, here you get more security related functionality and a few simplification:

 - 2FA is enforced for admins. You can enable TOTP based 2FA authentication. Any authenticator application (Google authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, LastPass, etc.) could be used, the QR code is generated by a javascript (= it is generated at client side). You should not use any internet facing administration interface, where 2FA is not enabled. Every new service suffers etremely high number of login attempts, passwords do not protect you!
 - Passwords are measured with enthropy: to avoid users from picking simple passwords, the enhropy of  

 - Based on SQLite (no need for DB server around). SQLite is absolutely useable for such small scale applications, there is no need to operate (manage and maintain) a database server for this purpose. Play with your kids instead! OpenSMTPd on the other hand comes without MariaDB support (you can recompile, though), thus SQLite is more convenient from the mailer daemon point of view as well. 

 - Extended logging: all security related operations, like login, logoff, password change, etc., plus all activities (all changes) are logged into the database. Logs can be seen on the user interface as well.
